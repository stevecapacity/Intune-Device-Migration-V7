# Intune Device Migration | V7

The Intune Device Migration solution allows devices to be off-boarded from their existing tenant and automatically joined to their destination in a matter of minutes; all while retaining user data.

Using a custom solution that leverages PowerShell scripting, Microsoft Graph API, and Windows provisioning packages, organizations can migrate Windows PCs between tenants with minimal downtime and user disruption.
